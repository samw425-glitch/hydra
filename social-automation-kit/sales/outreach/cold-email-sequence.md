Variables: {{ProspectName}}, {{BusinessName}}, {{City}}, {{Offer}}, {{BrandName}}, {{CalendarLink}}

Email 1 — Problem/Solution
Subject: Quick way to keep {{BusinessName}} active on social for $150/mo
Hi {{ProspectName}},
Most {{City}} businesses struggle to post consistently across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We run it for you: 3 posts/week per platform, approval-first, monthly reporting — $150/mo flat. Want a sample 1-week calendar for {{BusinessName}}?
— {{BrandName}}

Email 2 — Proof/Process
Subject: What your next 30 days would look like
Hi {{ProspectName}},
Here’s the simple flow: subscribe → brief onboarding → we draft a 30-day calendar → you approve → we schedule. It stays personalized to {{BusinessName}}’s offers. If it helps, I can send a free 7-day content plan. Interested?

Email 3 — Micro-commitment
Subject: Should I send Tuesday’s post ideas?
Hi {{ProspectName}},
I’ve got 3 post ideas for {{BusinessName}} tailored to {{City}}. If you reply “yes”, I’ll share them and you can decide if this fits at $150/mo.
— {{BrandName}}

Email 4 — Breakup
Subject: Close the loop?
Hi {{ProspectName}},
If now’s not the time, no worries. If you want the free 7-day plan for later, just say “send it”.
