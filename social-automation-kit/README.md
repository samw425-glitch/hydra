Contents

- Reporting Kit (KPIs, report template)
- Payments Setup (Stripe $150/mo)
- Sample Content Pack (1-week example)

Quickstart
1) Set your brand name in all templates: find and replace {{BrandName}} with your brand (e.g., Hydra Social Growth).
2) Create Stripe product and Checkout link (see payments/setup.md). 
3) Publish the landing page (website/index.html) and connect the Checkout link.
4) Use outreach scripts to book calls or trials.
5) Send onboarding questionnaire to new clients and collect platform access.
6) Personalize prompts and generate the first 30-day content calendar.
7) Implement automation: intake → approval → scheduling → reporting.
8) Review monthly KPIs and iterate.

Ideal Scope for $150/mo
- Platforms: Twitter (X), Facebook Page, Instagram Business.
- Cadence: 3 posts/week per platform (≈36 posts/month across 3 channels).
- Content: Personalized, growth-focused posts with offers/CTAs.
- Includes scheduling, light engagement guidelines, monthly report.
- Excludes: Paid ads, custom graphics/video production beyond templates, community management beyond quick replies.

Notes
- Instagram requires a Business Account connected to a Facebook Page for API scheduling.
- Use Buffer/Publer/Later for low-friction scheduling. 
- Keep everything templated and repeatable; personalize via variables.
