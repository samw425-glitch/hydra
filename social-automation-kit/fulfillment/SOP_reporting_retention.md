# SOP: Reporting & Retention

KPI Snapshot (monthly)
- Reach/impressions, profile visits, link clicks, DMs, follower delta.
- Top 3 posts: what worked and why.

Process
1) Export analytics from Buffer/Publer or native platform insights.
2) Populate the Report Template and summarize insights.
3) Add next-month action items (timing, topics, offers).
4) Share report + schedule a 10-minute check-in if needed.

Retention Tactics
- Provide a small win every month (e.g., new offer promo, giveaway idea).
- Quarterly refresh of hashtag banks and brand voice notes.
- Propose upsell when signals warrant (ads, UGC, additional posts/week).
