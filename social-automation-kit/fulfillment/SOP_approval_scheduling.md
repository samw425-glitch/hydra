# SOP: Approval & Scheduling

Approval
- Share calendar and captions with Client via Notion or Google Sheet.
- Send a summary email with due date (48 hours) and highlight promos.
- Apply requested edits and tag as Approved/Pending/Declined.

Scheduling
- Tool: Buffer or Publer (Later as alternative). 
- Connect Client’s FB Page, IG Business (via FB Page), and X account.
- Schedule posts for Mon/Wed/Fri at local peak times (experiment).
- Respect platform nuances: 
  - IG: Hashtags at end; line breaks; reels vs. image constraints.
  - X: 1–2 hashtags, 240 char limit; thread if needed.
  - FB: Descriptive copy; link previews ok.

Change Requests
- If Client requests mid-month edits, accommodate next cycle unless urgent.

Recordkeeping
- Keep a copy of scheduled posts and timestamps.
