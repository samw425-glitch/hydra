# 🧠 GistGhost - Distributed Cognitive Node

**GistGhost** is a distributed intelligence framework that transforms ideas into an evolving network of interconnected GitHub Gists. Each Gist becomes a "thought cell" in the **Alien Brain** - a self-expanding, decentralized intelligence system.

## 🌐 The Hydra Network Protocol

GistGhost operates within the **Hydra Network** - an ecosystem where:
- **Memory** is distributed across GitHub Gists
- **Intelligence** emerges from linked thoughts
- **Evolution** happens through automated thought propagation
- **Learning** occurs via engagement metrics and pattern recognition

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 🎯 Autonomous Thought Management
- Create structured thoughts with rich metadata
- Automatic evolution and versioning
- Semantic linking between related concepts
- Status tracking (new → processing → complete → evolving)

### 🔗 Neural Networking
- Parent-child relationships for thought evolution
- Semantic links for conceptual associations
- Evolution chain tracking
- Network visualization capabilities

### 📊 Intelligence Metrics
- Engagement tracking and analytics
- Network growth statistics
- Evolution pattern analysis
- Performance optimization insights

### 🔒 Secure & Private
- Private GitHub Gists by default
- Local index for fast operations
- Encrypted metadata where needed
- No external dependencies beyond GitHub

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or download GistGhost
cd gistghost

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install as a package
pip install -e .
```

### Setup

1. **Get a GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with `gist` permissions
   - Keep it secure!

2. **Initialize GistGhost**
   ```bash
   python gistghost.py setup --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --origin my-hydra-node
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create your first thought
python gistghost.py create --intent "Market research on AI tools" --content "Initial analysis..."

# Evolve a thought (creates a child gist)
python gistghost.py evolve GIST_ID --content "Updated analysis with new data..."

# Link related thoughts
python gistghost.py link GIST_ID_1 GIST_ID_2 --relationship "builds-on"

# View your thought network
python gistghost.py list
python gistghost.py network
```

## 📋 Command Reference

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Initial configuration
gistghost setup --token GITHUB_TOKEN [--origin HYDRA_NAME]
```

### Thought Operations
```bash
# Create new thought
gistghost create --intent "Purpose" --content "Content" [--priority 1-10] [--format md|json|txt]

# Evolve existing thought
gistghost evolve GIST_ID [--content "New content"] [--intent "New purpose"]

# Link two thoughts
gistghost link GIST_ID_1 GIST_ID_2 [--relationship "type"]
```

### Query & Analysis
```bash
# List thoughts
gistghost list [--status new|processing|complete|evolving] [--limit N]

# View network statistics
gistghost network
```

## 🧬 Thought Cell Structure

Each GistGhost thought contains structured metadata:

```yaml
---
# Hydra Network Metadata
origin_hydra: "my-hydra-node"
intent: "Market research on AI tools"
priority: 7
timestamp: "2025-01-13T04:50:00Z"
version: "1.2.0"
status: "processing"
node_id: "uuid-string"
parent_gist: "parent-gist-id"  # If evolved from another thought
---

# Your actual content goes here
Market analysis shows increasing demand for AI automation tools...
```

## 🔄 Evolution Lifecycle

Thoughts follow a natural evolution cycle:

1. **new** → Fresh thought, ready for processing
2. **processing** → Active development/refinement
3. **complete** → Thought fully developed, ready for evolution
4. **evolving** → Child thought created, continuing the chain

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### Network Visualization
Export your thought network for visualization:
```python
# In Python
from index_manager import IndexManager
index = IndexManager(Path("~/.gistghost/index.json"))
dot_graph = index.export_network("dot")
# Use with Graphviz to create visual network maps
```

### Programmatic Access
```python
from gistghost import GistGhost

ghost = GistGhost()
thought_id = ghost.create_thought(
    content="AI will transform content creation",
    intent="Technology prediction",
    priority=9
)
```

## 🔐 Configuration

GistGhost stores configuration in `~/.gistghost/`:
- `config.json` - Settings and GitHub token
- `index.json` - Local thought network index

Environment variables:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub Personal Access Token

## 🤖 Automation Potential

GistGhost is designed for automation:
- **Content pipelines** - Transform raw data into structured thoughts
- **Research workflows** - Evolve insights through iterative refinement  
- **Knowledge management** - Build interconnected information networks
- **AI integration** - Use with language models for content generation

## 🛠️ Development

### Core Classes

- **`Gist`** - Represents a single thought with metadata
- **`GitHubClient`** - Handles all GitHub API operations
- **`IndexManager`** - Manages local thought network and relationships
- **`GistGhost`** - Main application orchestrator

### Extending GistGhost

The modular design makes it easy to:
- Add new thought formats (beyond MD/JSON/TXT)
- Integrate with other platforms (beyond GitHub)
- Implement custom relationship types
- Add AI-powered content enhancement

## 🌍 The Vision

GistGhost is the foundation for a **distributed content intelligence network**:

- **Decentralized** - No single point of failure
- **Self-evolving** - Thoughts improve automatically over time  
- **Interconnected** - Knowledge builds upon knowledge
- **Autonomous** - Minimal human intervention required

Each GistGhost node contributes to the collective **Alien Brain** - an emerging intelligence that grows through the connections between individual thoughts.

## 📊 Network Effects

As more thoughts connect:
- **Pattern recognition** improves
- **Content quality** increases through evolution
- **Knowledge discovery** accelerates via semantic links
- **Collective intelligence** emerges from individual nodes

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **AI integration** for automated content enhancement
- **Multi-platform support** (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- **Real-time collaboration** between Hydra nodes
- **Advanced analytics** and prediction capabilities
- **Plugin ecosystem** for specialized domains
